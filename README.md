# K8s: a gentle introduction

This repository contains all the materials used in the presentation "K8s: a gentle introduction" by [Giovanni Antonioni](https://github.com/giovaz94).

## Setup

We will emulate a Kubernetes cluster using [K3D](https://k3d.io/v5.7.2/), a lightweight wrapper to run K3s (Rancher Lab's minimal Kubernetes distribution) in Docker.

Refer to the official documentation for the [installation](https://k3d.io/v5.7.2/#install-specific-release) instructions
